Wukong CRM adopts a new front-end and back-end separation mode. This warehouse code has integrated the front-end vue packaged files, which can eliminate the packaging operation

If you need to adjust the front-end code, please download the front-end code separately, the front-end code is in the ux folder of the root directory


## Main technology stack

Core framework: jfinal3.8

Cache: redis caffeine

Database connection pool: Druid

Tools: hutool, fastjson, poi-ooxml

Timing task: jfinal-cron

Project build tool: maven

Web container: tomcat, undertow (default)

Front-end MVVM framework: Vue.JS 2.5.x

Routing: Vue-Router 3.x

Data interaction: Axios

UI framework: Element-UI 2.6.3



## Installation Notes

1. Configure java operating environment, redis environment and mysql environment.
2. Import crm9.sql under the directory doc into the database (`Initial installation only needs to import crm9.sql, update the code and import the sql file of the corresponding date`).
3. Modify the database configuration file under `resources/config/crm9-config.txt`.
4. Modify the redis connection file under `resources/config/redis.json`
5. Undertow start port number is modified under `resources/config/undertow.txt`.
Default account admin Default password 123456



## Deployment instructions

The JDK of this project requires JDK8 and above


### One, Undertow (default)


```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jfinal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jfinal-undertow</artifactId>
    <version>1.9</version>
</dependency>
```

Uncomment the above code, comment out the tomcat pom dependency javax.servlet.javax.servlet-api, change the packaging method to jar and run maven package, after the packaging is complete
Upload the crm9-release.zip file generated by the above packaging command to the server and decompress it, and run the corresponding 72crm.sh/72crm.bat.

### Two, Tomcat deployment


```
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Uncomment the above code, comment out the undertow pom dependency com.jfinal.jfinal-undertow, comment out the main method of com.kakarote.crm9.Application, and change the packaging method to war.
Run the maven package command and place the war package in the `tomcat/webapps` directory

The default project is ROOT.war. If you need to carry the project name, you need to modify the BASE_API of ux/config/prod.env.js to'"/project name/"'. After the modification is completed, you need to repackage and replace it under webapp


The project webapp comes with the packaged front-end code, if you don’t need to change the front-end code, just visit it directly
If you change the front-end code, you need to replace the static folder and index.html under the packaged dist under webapp
ps: You can use `nginx` to proxy static files. The background only responds to the interface. The design of the project itself is completely separated from the front and back ends.



### Front-end deployment

Installing node.js The front-end part is based on node.js running, so you must first install `node.js`, the version requirement is 6.0 or more

Use npm to install dependencies Download the Wukong CRM9.0 front-end code; you can place the code in the back-end directory ux at the same level, and execute the command to install the dependencies:

    npm install

Modify internal configuration Modify request address or domain name: Modify BASE_API (development environment server address, default localhost) in config/dev.env.js Modify custom port: port parameter of dev object in config/index.js (default 8090, It is not recommended to modify)

### Run the front end

     npm run dev

Note: When the front-end service is started, port 8090 is occupied by default, so before starting the front-end service, please make sure that port 8090 is not occupied.
The server must be built before the program runs
